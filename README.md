# My Personal Project

## Proposal

***What will the application do?***

The application will be a turn based Pokemon battling game.
It will include at least one of two battling modes: person vs person or 
person vs computer.
The battles will be 3 on 3 battles and the trainer(s) will get to choose 
the Pokemon they use.
There will also be some function that allows users to create Pokemon of their 
own, which they can then use in the battles.

***Who will use it?***

Anyone can use it. It's just a matter of if they want to play the game or not. 

***Why is this project of interest?***

Since I was young I have enjoyed playing Pokemon and I feel as though 
this project will give me a chance to make something based on the game 
I have enjoyed for so long.

## User Stories

to the list of Pokemon usable for battle
- As a user, I want to be able to view all the Pokemon that are available to use 
in battle
- As a user, I want to be able to select the 3 Pokemon that I use for battle

currently have in the battle for another Pokemon in my party
